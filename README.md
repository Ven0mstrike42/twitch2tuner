# twitch2dvr

Inspired by the likes of [locast2plex](https://github.com/tgorgdotcom/locast2plex) and [locast2dvr](https://github.com/wouterdebie/locast2dvr) and the fact that there is no officially supported way to watch Twitch on a Roku device, twitch2dvr aims to present live Twitch streams as channels within Plex's [Live TV and DVR feature](https://support.plex.tv/articles/225877347-live-tv-dvr/).
